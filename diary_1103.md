## Classes

* a class is a construction plan of an object
* an object "zeigt" to a class and is an instance of that class.
* class diagram
* public means, you can access that method from outside, e.g in other methods.
* private only works within the object that it's written in
* variables always private, methods always public
* class diagrams list the name of the class, the attributes (name and datatype of variables) and the methods (methodname and return type)
* you cannot save primitive datatypes in ArrayLists
* with getVariable and setVariable, you can access variables from another class even though they're private
