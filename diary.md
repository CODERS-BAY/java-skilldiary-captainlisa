# Skill Diary Java

## February 5th 2020

* Remembered what a flowchart is and how to write one. It's an important tool to visualize the structure of code before writing it. The different features in the code have different symbols/boxes to distinguish between different functions.
* We started with simple Java exercises like declaring and initializing variables and using loops, switches and if-else.
* __while loop__: 
````java
while (condition) {
    //code that is going to be executed
}
````
* The difference between the while-loop and do/while-loop is that the while-loop checks the condition before the code is executed; the do/while-loop runs the code at least once, because the condition is tested at the end of the loop. While is head controlled; do/while is foot controlled.
* __for loop__:
```java
for (int i = 1; i < 10; i++) {
    System.out.println(i);
}
```
* if-else makes it possible to check for different specified cases and execute a number of different codes.
```java
if (condition) {
    //code
} else if (condition) {
    //code
} else {
    //code
}
````
