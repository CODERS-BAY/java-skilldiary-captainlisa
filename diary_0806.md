* With Shift+F6 you can rename a variable and all its uses! VERY useful :D

# Inheritance

* if you create a class that inherits something from a parent class. the first thing you have to do in the constructor of the new class is to call the constructor of the parent class with the keyword ```super```
* a class can only inherit from one class, but it can implement from more than one interface
* both, abstract classes and interfaces can not be instantiated (?), but others can inherit from them
* a method in an interface is like an abstract method from a parent class. all classes that inherit from it have to have it
* interface is like a contract with the class that implements it. its like adjectives for classes.
