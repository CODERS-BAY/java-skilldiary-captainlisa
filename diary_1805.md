* optimized the Personnell Management by changing the ArrayList to List. The reason is, that if an ArrayList is used, there are different methods available for the list. so instead of:
```java
static ArrayList<Person> LIST_OF_PEOPLE = new ArrayList<Person>(); 
```
we write:
```java
static List<Person> LIST_OF_PEOPLE = new ArrayList<Person>();
```
* remembered how to do arithmatic with fractionals.
* ```Math.min(); ``` and ```Math.max();``` are both inbuilt functions in java. min returns the minimum of two numbers and max the maximum. 
* the funtion ```getClass();``` returns the Class of a certain number.
